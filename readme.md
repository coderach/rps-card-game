# Deception Magic Attack Card Game

A strategic twist on the classic Deception Magic Attack game where each player has cards with weighted Deception, Magic, and Attack values that sum to 20. Available in both console and web versions with NFT simulation capabilities.

## 🎮 Game Mechanics

### Card Structure
- Each card has 3 properties: Deception, Magic, Attack
- Each property has a value between 1-9
- All three values must sum to exactly 20
- Example cards: `(Deception: 2, Magic: 9, Attack: 9)` or `(Deception: 5, Magic: 8, Attack: 7)`

### Game Modes

#### Single-Card Mode (1 Card per Player)
1. **Setup**: Each player gets 1 randomly generated card (hidden from opponent)
2. **Rounds**: 3 rounds total
   - Round 1 & 2: Players choose which property to play
   - Round 3: Auto-played (remaining property)
3. **Strategy**: Timing is key - save strong properties or play them early?

#### Multi-Card Mode (3 Cards per Player) 
1. **Setup**: Each player gets 3 randomly generated cards (hidden from opponent)
2. **Rounds**: 3 rounds total
   - Each round: Players choose which card AND which property to play
   - No auto-play - all rounds require strategic decisions
3. **Strategy**: Card selection adds deep strategic layer

### Scoring Rules
Points awarded based on:
- **Same property**: Higher value wins the difference
- **Different properties**: You must have BOTH the winning property AND higher value to score
- **Deception beats Attack beats Magic beats Deception**

### Winning
- Player with the highest total score after all rounds wins
- Ties are possible and tracked in statistics

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 12.0.0 or higher) for console version
- Modern web browser for web version

## 📊 Testing & Statistics

### Automated Testing (Console)
```bash
# Run all tests with comprehensive analysis
npm run test-all

# Individual test categories

npm run test-random    # AI effectiveness measurement
npm run test-multi     # Multi-card mode analysis
```

### Multi-Card vs Single-Card Analysis
The testing suite reveals:
- **Single-card games**: ~40-50% tie rate
- **Multi-card games**: ~5-10% tie rate (much more decisive!)
- **Score distributions**: Multi-card games have higher, more varied scores
- **Strategic depth**: Multi-card mode offers exponentially more decisions

### Key Metrics Tracked
- Win/loss/tie percentages
- Score distributions and averages
- Tie rate reduction analysis
- AI performance vs random play
- Card balance analysis

## 📈 Mathematical Analysis

**Total Possible Cards**: 36 unique combinations

For cards where Deception + Magic + Attack = 20 (each property 1-9):
- Deception = 2: 1 combination
- Deception = 3: 2 combinations  
- Deception = 4: 3 combinations
- ...continuing this pattern...
- Deception = 9: 8 combinations

Total: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = **36 cards**

### Card Categories
- **Balanced Cards**: ~12 cards with max 3-point difference between properties
- **Extreme Cards**: Cards with 9s offer high single-round scoring potential
- **Defensive Cards**: Balanced distributions limit opponent scoring opportunities

## 🎯 Strategy Tips

### Single-Card Mode:
- **Early Strong Play**: Use highest values early when you have more choices
- **Property Prediction**: Anticipate opponent's remaining strong properties
- **Risk Management**: Balance safe plays vs high-scoring attempts

### Multi-Card Mode:
- **Card Sequencing**: Strategic order of card usage
- **Property Distribution**: Spread strong properties across different cards
- **Adaptive Strategy**: React to opponent's revealed cards
- **Resource Management**: Save strongest card-property combinations
- **Psychological Elements**: Bluffing and misdirection

### Web Interface Strategy:
- **Card Collection Analysis**: Study all 36 cards before selection
- **Synergy Building**: Choose cards that complement each other
- **Meta-game Thinking**: Consider opponent's likely card selection patterns
